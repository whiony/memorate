# Memorate

>  **Remember what you liked – prices, places & products at a glance.**

Memorate is an iOS app that saves you from “Did I already buy this?” moments.
Built with TypeScript, React Native, Firebase, Cloudinary, and Expo Go.

This repo is source-available: you can read, run, and modify it for personal use — but not redistribute it or upload clones to app stores. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## ✨ Highlights

* **Quick capture** – name, ⭐ rating, price, photo & note in seconds.
* **Smart filters** – sort by date, price or rating to find anything fast.
* **Dark / Light theme** – respects your system setting.
* **Multi‑photo & crop** – save up to three pics for every item.
* **100 % offline first** – all data stays on your device; iCloud sync coming soon.

Use-case: snap that salami today, rate it, and next month you’ll instantly know if it was worth a re-buy.
Handy for the forgetful (hi, that’s me).
